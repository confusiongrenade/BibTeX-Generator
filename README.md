This is a web app to improve the quality of  citations for Notre Dame's Library web system.  It is implemented by removing the ineffective citation system  and replacing it with a series of buttons.  These buttons scrape the title of the work of the page the user is on, and then query Google Scholar for the relevant entry.  Then, our Grease Monkey script (utilized through [plugins](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?utm_source=gmail) on Chrome) automatically clicks throught the Google Scholar search pages to take you to the relevant citation reference.  The main focus of this program was to introduce bibTeX citations to the Hesburgh Library Systems.
